# 6-DOF Flight Simulation Validation Dataset from NASA 

This folder provides access to the **Six-Degree-of-Freedom (6-DOF) Flight Simulation Check-cases** published by the **NASA Engineering and Safety Center (NESC)** in 2015.

These check-cases are a collection of **validation datasets** intended for benchmarking, verification, and comparison of 6-DOF flight dynamics simulation tools. They include *pre-defined vehicle models*, *initial conditions*, and *trajectory outputs* for a wide range of atmospheric and exo-atmospheric (orbital) scenarios. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## 📌 Purpose

The goal of this dataset is to:

- Provide a **common set of verification cases** for simulation practitioners and researchers.
- Facilitate **cross-comparison** between different flight simulation implementations.
- Support validation of equations-of-motion and environmental models such as geodesy, gravitation, and atmospheric effects. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## 📁 Contents

The dataset includes:

- **DAVE-ML vehicle models** for both atmospheric and orbital cases. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
- **Initial condition spreadsheets** (.xlsx) for each scenario. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
- **Trajectory time histories** in CSV format. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}
- **Technical reports and documentation** describing the check-cases and comparison methodology. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

### Included Scenarios

The check-cases cover a broad range of scenarios such as:

**Atmospheric Flight Cases**
- Simple bodies (spheres, tumbling bricks)
- Winged aircraft (e.g. F-16)
- Two-stage rocket ascent  
(*plus additional cases with variable winds, drag, and geodetic conditions*) :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}

**Orbital (Exo-Atmospheric) Flight Cases**
- ISS orbit propagation
- Spherical and cylindrical bodies with various gravitational and perturbation models  
(*plus additional orbital dynamics scenarios*) :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}
