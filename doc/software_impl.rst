Software Implementation
=======================

The numerical implementation of this SVA-based flight-dynamics model is
being developed in the following repository:

- Aetherion: https://github.com/onurtuncer/Aetherion

The repository contains (or will contain):

- SVA-based rigid-body dynamics and utilities,
- atmospheric and gravity models,
- algorithmic differentiation hooks (e.g. via CppAD),
- FMU export infrastructure (e.g. via FMU4cpp),
- test cases and validation scenarios.
